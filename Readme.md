# PyApps

I love to create windows app using **Python tkinter** in my free time. So I create a project named **PyApps** to those apps with all of you.

Follow this url to the website
[PyApps](https://pyapps.web.app)

I create these apps as hobby. These apps are free use.

While downloading any app from the site or installing that to your device you might encounter errors something like "unknown app, this might contain virus".
I ensure you that I do not write any malicious code.
If it contain any malicious code then that will be inside the source code the libraries which I use withouting knowning about that malicious code.

## Source Code

Here is the source code of the apps
